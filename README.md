## Features

 - Support for Linux.
 - Support for Vulkan.
 - Rendering of multiple .obj 3D models with textures.
	- Mipmapping.
	- Msaa multisampling.
 - First-person 3D camera (1rst iteration)
 - In-house event system (1rst iteration)

## Road map

I've created a Trello board to provide some insight on what I have planned for the future of the game engine.
On this board, you'll find upcoming features, target time frames, and any emergent known issues.
Please note that at this time, the current Trello is in English only.

You can find the board [here](https://trello.com/b/pKXNk3bb/road-map).
